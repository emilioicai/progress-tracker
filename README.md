# Project Tracker

Sample project using React, TypeScript and Redux

## Setup
([yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) needs to be installed first)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- `open http://localhost:3000`

## Notes
- This project is using [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) to simplify the organisation of Redux components
- The most complex component is src/components/ProgressCircle
- Unittests and proper styling were not added in this initial version as the focus is on TS, React and Redux. They will be taken care later
